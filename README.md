## LAUNCHPAD PART 1
### Section Description
The first step was to use the MicroPico to print a 10 second countdown to the terminal, ending with "Liftoff" at 0 seconds.

### Code

### Reflection
The only problem I had was that I forgot how for loops worked, and then forgot how ranges worked. The simple solution was just "google it", so I don't really have much to say for this part.

&nbsp;
## LAUNCHPAD PART 2
### Assignment Description
The second step was to make a red LED blink on every second of the countdown, then turn on a green LED on liftoff.

### Code

### Reflection
This assignment was the mandatory "you forgot how LED wiring works and thus the assignment takes 3x longer" assignment this year. Once I remembered what I was doing (and which side of the LED is positive, its the long side) it ended up being very easy.

## LAUNCHPAD PART 3
### Assignment Description
Adding onto the previous parts, the next step was to add a button to start the countdown, and pressing the button again would force stop the countdown.

### Code
[the code :)](https://github.com/jvaugha3038/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/countdown3.py)

### Reflection

This assignment served the same general purpose as the last one, being the "heres how to wire a button again" assignment. I used a panel mount button to save space. Overall, not that challenging.

&nbsp;
## LAUNCHPAD PART 4
### Assignment Description
The final part of this assignment was to make a servo spin form 0 to 180 degrees on liftoff.

### Wiring



### Code
[the whole everything]()

### Reflection
Caompared to the other ones, this one posed a slight challenge. This was mainly because I had to play The Servo Lottery since some of them just didn't work for a variety of reasons. Once I found a functioning servo, finished the code, and tested it, I was ready to record it. **However,** the servo had other plans, and then proceeded to not work ever again. In the code, I made the servo spin from 1 to 179 degrees to avoid having it get stuck at 180 again.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
